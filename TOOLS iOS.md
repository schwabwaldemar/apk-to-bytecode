# List of Useful iOS Analysis Tools

These tools are widely used by security professionals and researchers for various security analysis tasks, including vulnerability research, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.

1. **Cydia**
   - **Purpose:** Cydia is a package manager mobile app for jailbroken iOS devices. It allows users to discover and install software packages on jailbroken iOS devices.
   - **Example Code:** N/A

2. **ssh und scp**
   - **Purpose:** `ssh` (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. `scp` (Secure Copy) is a command-line utility that allows secure transfer of files between hosts on a network.
   - **Example Code:** 
     ```
     ssh username@hostname
     scp file.txt username@hostname:/remote/directory
     ```

3. **libimobiledevice**
   - **Purpose:** libimobiledevice is an open-source software library that allows communication with iOS devices. It enables various functionalities like accessing the filesystem, retrieving information, and performing backups.
   - **Example Code:** N/A

4. **class-dump**
   - **Purpose:** class-dump is a command-line utility for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O files. It helps in reverse engineering iOS and macOS applications by providing information about classes and methods.
   - **Example Code:** 
     ```
     class-dump -H /path/to/executable
     ```

5. **dumpdecrypted**
   - **Purpose:** dumpdecrypted is a tool used for decrypting iOS executable files encrypted with Apple's FairPlay DRM. It is often used in conjunction with class-dump for analyzing iOS applications.
   - **Example Code:** N/A

6. **lipo**
   - **Purpose:** lipo is a command-line utility for creating or operating on universal binary files. It allows developers to manipulate binaries containing code for multiple architectures.
   - **Example Code:** 
     ```
     lipo -info executable
     ```

7. **cycript**
   - **Purpose:** Cycript is a scripting language and REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows developers and security researchers to dynamically inspect, modify, and interact with running iOS applications.
   - **Example Code:** N/A

8. **Hopper**
   - **Purpose:** Hopper is a reverse engineering tool used for disassembling and decompiling applications for various platforms, including iOS and macOS. It helps in analyzing the behavior of applications and understanding their inner workings.
   - **Example Code:** N/A

9. **IDA Pro**
   - **Purpose:** IDA Pro is a powerful disassembler and debugger used for reverse engineering binary executables. It supports a wide range of platforms and executable formats, making it a versatile tool for security analysis.
   - **Example Code:** N/A
