   - Purpose: For packaging and extracting Dalvik code from APKs.
   - Usage: `apktool d <APK_FILE> -o <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`

3. **enjarify**
   - Purpose: For converting Dalvik bytecode to Java bytecode.
   - Usage: `enjarify <INPUT_DEX_FILE> -o <OUTPUT_JAR_FILE>`

4. **dex2jar** (Note: May be deprecated)
   - Purpose: For converting Dalvik bytecode to Java bytecode.
